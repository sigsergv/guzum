qmake CONFIG+=debug

MacOS
=====

You need brew installed and gpgme from brew. Also install Qt (5.15.2 in my case).

    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Qt/5.7/clang_64/bin
    ~/Qt/5.15.2/clang_64/bin/qmake "CONFIG+=debug"
    make
    ~/Qt/5.15.2/clang_64/bin/macdeployqt guzum.app -dmg
    open guzum.dmg

MacOS Deployment
================

Clean up:

    make distclean
    rm -rf guzum.app

Compile:

    ~/Qt/5.15.2/clang_64/bin/qmake "CONFIG+=release"
    make

Prepare:

    ~/Qt/5.15.2/clang_64/bin/macdeployqt guzum.app

Check deps (we need to provide only Qt frameworks):

    otool -L guzum.app/Contents/MacOS/guzum

We need to place frameworks into the package and otool should finally display
these deps from the .app, not system-wide.

We can optionally create .dmg file:

    cd scripts
    ./create-dmg
